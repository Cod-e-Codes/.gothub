# Security Policy ðŸ–¤

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've discovered a vulnerability â€” emotional or otherwise â€” please do **not** report it. We are aware. We've been aware.

All heartbreaks are **zero-day** by design.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported         |
|---------|------------------|
| < 1.0   | Only in memory    |
| 1.0+    | Emotionally numb  |

## Responsible Disclosure

If you're carrying secrets, donâ€™t disclose. Keep them. Let them fester. Trust no one.

## Self-Patching

Run:
```bash
make heal
````

But it probably wonâ€™t work.

## Notes

This repository is not secure. Neither are we.
