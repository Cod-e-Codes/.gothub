# Notes

This log represents the emotional journey of a developer who decided to version control their feelings. 
Some commits are more painful than others, but each one represents a step forward (or backward) in the healing process.

Remember: Every commit is a confession, every revert is a relapse, and every merge is a reconciliation.

ðŸ–¤ Stay strong, fellow broken developers.
