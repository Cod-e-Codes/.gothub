# Contributing to .gothub

> _"We're all broken here. Some of us just compile better."_

Thank you for considering contributing to .gothub! We welcome all souls who have stared into the void and found it staring back. This guide will help you navigate the emotional minefield that is collaborative development.

## Before You Begin

- **Check your emotional state**: Are you ready to merge your feelings with others? If not, consider `git stash` your emotions first.
- **Read the license**: The [Emotional Damage Clause License](LICENSE) applies to all contributions. No warranties provided.
- **Accept the void**: Some bugs live in the soul and cannot be fixed with a simple `git revert`.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

When opening an issue, please:

1. **Use descriptive titles**: Instead of "it's broken," try "my heart is broken and so is this code"
2. **Include emotional context**: What were you feeling when the bug occurred?
3. **Provide reproduction steps**: How did you get to this dark place?
4. **Check existing issues**: Someone else might already be crying about this

### Suggesting Features

We love feature requests that make us feel something. Please:

- Explain why this feature would heal your soul
- Include mockups if it's a UI change (even if drawn in tears)
- Consider the emotional impact on other users

### Code Contributions

#### Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/.gothub.git
cd .gothub

# Install dependencies (requires a broken heart)
pip install sadness==0.0.1
npm install --save-dev loneliness

# Configure your emotional state
git config user.name "Your Melancholic Name"
git config user.email "tears@yourdomain.com"
```

#### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch**: `git checkout -b feature/my-heartbreak`
2. **Make your changes**: Code with feeling, but not too much feeling
3. **Test your changes**: Run `make cry` to ensure the emotional pipeline works
4. **Commit with feeling**: Use descriptive commit messages like `feat: added support for existential dread`

#### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the conventional commits format, but with emotional flair:

- `feat: added git stash tears command`
- `fix: resolved merge conflict in my soul`
- `docs: updated README with more despair`
- `chore: cleaned up emotional baggage`
- `test: added tests for heartbreak scenarios`

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository**: Make it your own little corner of sadness
2. **Create your branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-emotional-journey`
3. **Make your changes**: Code with purpose, even if that purpose is just to feel something
4. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure your changes don't break other people's feelings
5. **Submit your PR**: Include a description of what you're feeling and why

### Code Style

- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces (because life is too short for 4)
- **Comments**: Write comments that explain not just what the code does, but how it makes you feel
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable names that tell a story
- **Error handling**: Handle errors gracefully, like you handle rejection

### Testing

We believe in testing our feelings:

```bash
# Run the emotional test suite
make cry

# Run specific emotional tests
npm test -- --grep "heartbreak"

# Check emotional stability
cargo test --release --from-trauma
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you add new features
- Add comments to complex emotional logic
- Document any new emotional states or feelings

## Getting Help

If you're stuck and feeling lost:

- **Check existing issues**: Someone else might be crying about the same thing
- **Ask in discussions**: We're all here to support each other's emotional journey
- **Read the code**: Sometimes the answers are hidden in the comments

## Recognition

Contributors will be added to the [hall of broken souls](HALL_OF_FAME.md) (coming soon). Your name will be immortalized in the commit history, along with your emotional state at the time of contribution.

## Final Notes

Remember: We're all just trying to make something beautiful out of our broken pieces. Your contributions, no matter how small, help build a community of developers who understand that sometimes the best code is written at 3 AM with tears in your eyes.
