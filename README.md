# .gothub

A version control system for unresolved emotions, existential dread, and poorly committed relationships. Because sometimes you need to `git blame` your past to move forward.

## Purpose

.gothub is not your average Git repo. It's a terminal-punk playground for versioning your feelings, stashing your tears, and merging your heartbreak. Built for developers who wear black eyeliner and write Bash scripts at 3 a.m., it's a parody of Git that processes the human condition with sarcastic puns and melancholic wit.

## Example Commands

```bash
git blame past_love        # Who broke your heart in line 42?
git stash tears            # Save your crying for later
git checkout old_self      # Revert to who you were before *that* relationship
git merge existential_dread # Attempt to reconcile with reality (merge conflicts guaranteed)
git commit -m "still broken" # Immortalize your pain
git push regrets origin/master # Share your suffering with the world
```

## Installation

1. Clone the void:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gothub.com/user/.gothub.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (requires a broken heart):
   ```bash
   pip install sadness==0.0.1
   npm install --save-dev loneliness
   cargo build --release --from-trauma
   ```
3. Configure your user.soul:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Wistful Coder"
   git config --global user.email "tears@null.dev"
   ```
4. Run the emotional pipeline:
   ```bash
   make cry
   ```

## Emotional Pipeline

Running `make cry` initiates the full breakdown: tears are collected, feelings are re-indexed, and existential bugs are logged.  
Proceed only if your heart is ready.

üí° Emotional readiness check via `hooks/pre-commit` is enforced.  
Sometimes, it's okay to not commit.

## Warning

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This repo may cause bouts of introspection, emotional exhaustion, or sudden urges to delete your entire commit history.  
Use with caution, and always stash your tears before merging.

## Selective Forgetting

Some things aren't meant to be versioned. See `.gothubignore`:

```plaintext
# .gothubignore
closure/
exes/
hope/
feedback/
vulnerability.log
```

They live in memory, not in the repo.

## Known Issues

- üíî Memory leaks when revisiting old scars
- üò¢ Infinite loops of regret on `git blame`
- üêõ Occasional breakage of trust.exe leading to fatal runtime errors
- üò¥ Performance dips during bouts of existential dread
- üï≥Ô∏è Occasional black hole where all motivation disappears
- üíî Heartbreak cache sometimes fails to clear properly
- üò≠ Emotional overflow when processing too many feelings at once

## Contributing

Want to help fix some bugs in the heart?  
Fork, clone, and submit a pull request to help heal the repository's soul.  
Don't forget to run `make cry` before pushing ‚Äî emotional tests are mandatory!

## Getting Help

Help is available, but you have to ask for it.  
Try `man feelings`, or just message a friend.  
Remember: `git push` is not a substitute for therapy.

## FAQs

**Q:** Can I really `git stash tears`?  
**A:** Only if you remember where you put them.

**Q:** What happens if I `git reset --hard` on my feelings?  
**A:** You might lose unresolved baggage ‚Äî but some scars don't disappear that easily.

**Q:** How do I resolve a merge conflict in my soul?  
**A:** Sometimes you don't. You just learn to live with it.

**Q:** Is it normal to cry during code review?  
**A:** Absolutely. Emotional code reviews are the most honest ones.

**Q:** Can I revert emotional damage?  
**A:** You can try `git revert`, but some wounds run deeper than version control.

## File Manifesto

Most of the baggage is unpacked. The `README.md` wept itself into shape, the `LICENSE` finally admitted its terms, and `.gothubignore` knows what not to talk about. The pipeline is breaking as expected.

You're not staring into the void anymore ‚Äî it's versioned, linted, and documented.

Still, if something feels missing, it probably is.  
Check the [commit history](https://github.com/Cod-e-Codes/.gothub/commits/main) for emotional context.
