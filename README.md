# .gothub

A version control system for unresolved emotions, existential dread, and poorly committed relationships. Because sometimes you need to `git blame` your past to move forward.

> _“I uploaded a feeling. Git refused to track it.”_

## Purpose

.gothub is not your average Git repo. It's a terminal-punk playground for versioning your feelings, stashing your tears, and merging your heartbreak. Built for developers who wear black eyeliner and write Bash scripts at 3 a.m., it’s a parody of Git that processes the human condition with sarcastic puns and melancholic wit.

## Example Commands

```bash
git blame past_love        # Who broke your heart in line 42?
git stash tears            # Save your crying for later
git checkout old_self      # Revert to who you were before *that* relationship
git merge existential_dread # Attempt to reconcile with reality (merge conflicts guaranteed)
git commit -m "still broken" # Immortalize your pain
git push regrets origin/master # Share your suffering with the world
```

## Installation

1. Clone the void:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gothub.com/user/.gothub.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (requires a broken heart):
   ```bash
   pip install sadness==0.0.1
   npm install --save-dev loneliness
   cargo build --release --from-trauma
   ```
3. Configure your user.soul:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Wistful Coder"
   git config --global user.email "tears@null.dev"
   ```
4. Run the emotional pipeline:
   ```bash
   make cry
   ```
